# COVID-19 Mortality Analysis

This repository contains an extensive analysis of the "Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths by State and Age: Provisional 2020-2023" dataset. 
The analysis focuses on the impact of age, specific respiratory conditions, and yearly trends on COVID-19 mortality rates in the United States. 
The aim of this project is to deepen our understanding of the factors that influence COVID-19 mortality and provide actionable insights to inform 
public health interventions.

## Data Description

The dataset offers comprehensive details related to COVID-19 fatalities across the United States from 2020 to 2023. 
Key columns include demographic details, health conditions, COVID-19 specific variables, and other relevant information. 
Please refer to the [Data Description](Covid-19%20Project/Exploring%20Variations%20in%20COVID.pdf) for more details.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure its suitability for subsequent analysis. 
This includes handling missing data, data transformation, and filtering based on the formulated hypotheses. 
You can find detailed steps in the [Data Preprocessing](Covid-19%20Project/Exploring%20Variations%20in%20COVID.pdf) section.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizations were created to understand the distribution and trends in the data, focusing on the role of age, specific respiratory conditions, 
and yearly trends on COVID-19 fatalities. More information on this can be found in the [Exploratory Data Analysis](Covid-19%20Project/Exploring%20Variations%20in%20COVID.pdf) 
section.

## Hypothesis Testing

An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to determine if there are any significant differences in COVID-19 mortality rates across various age groups. 
The detailed procedure and results interpretation can be found in the [Hypothesis Testing](Covid-19%20Project/Exploring%20Variations%20in%20COVID.pdf) section.

## Results and Conclusion

The analysis provides strong evidence to affirm the proposed hypotheses, revealing significant differences in COVID-19 fatalities based on age, 
presence of specific respiratory conditions, and year. Detailed results and conclusions are presented in the report 'Exploring Variations in COVID.pdf' 
available in the project files.

## Project Files

The project folder 'Covid-19 Project' contains the following files:

## Tableau Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created using Tableau to visualize the analysis results. The dashboard provides an intuitive and easy way to understand the data 
and the findings. You can access the Tableau dashboard [here]([link-to-tableau-dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/ExploringVariationsinCOVID-19MortalityAnAnalysisofUnderlyingConditionsandAgeGroups/ExploringVariationsinCOVID-19MortalityAnAnalysisofUnderlyingConditionsandAgeGroups?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)https://public.tableau.com/views/ExploringVariationsinCOVID-19MortalityAnAnalysisofUnderlyingConditionsandAgeGroups/ExploringVariationsinCOVID-19MortalityAnAnalysisofUnderlyingConditionsandAgeGroups?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
